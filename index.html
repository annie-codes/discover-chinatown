            <h2>Chinatown Roots</h2>
            <p>Chinatown has long since expanded from the days of 1870s on Mott Street in New York City. With intense racism and bigotry towards Asians in the United States, the immigrant community formed a close knit community. After the US immigration policies allowed Asian countries to immigrate, Chinatown began to expand. As stated in the <a href="https://www.walksofnewyork.com/blog/ny-chinatown" target="_blank">Walks of New York</a>, Chinatown began to cross over into Little Italy and the Lower East Side. Today, there are countless Chinatowns throughout the United States, and New York City itself. <a href="directions.html">Getting there</a> is so close and easily accessible so go ahead and step into Chinatown and explore some <a href="spots.html">local spots</a>!</p>
